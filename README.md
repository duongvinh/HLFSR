# Light Field Super-Resolution Network Using Joint Spatio-Angular and Epipolar Information
This repository contains official pytorch implementation of "Light Field Super-Resolution Network Using Joint Spatio-Angular and Epipolar Information" submitted in IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging 2022, by Vinh Van Duong, Thuc Nguyen Huu, Jonghoon Yim, and Byeungwoo Jeon.

## Results
We share the SR LF images generated by our HLFSR-C32 and HLFSR-C64 model on all the 5 datasets for 2x and 4x SR, which are avaliable at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SaTT3iP4GruKcome8r97Y6y54Nrj4gc5

## Code
We will clean the code and make it avaiable soon!
